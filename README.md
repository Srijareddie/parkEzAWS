This fork of [ParkEz](https://github.com/swayambhu/parkEz) only exists to create a prototype of a Pipeline that can build and deploy the Frontend and Backend of parkEz, and host both Dev and QA versions of the project.

Code will be built and deployed automatically whenever code is commited on Github.
